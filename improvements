Repository Summary
The repository contains a Bash script cody and a README. cody implements a command-line assistant that interacts with a local LLM endpoint. The README documents usage, requirements, and slash commands.

Key sections:

Configuration variables at the top of cody including GEMMA_ENDPOINT and MODEL_NAME

Slash command help listing /image as a feature

Parsing user input for slash commands with a branch for "image") handle_image ;;

However, there is no handle_image function, and the README advertises the command:

- `/image` – paste an image from the clipboard to include in a prompt

handle_chat calls a missing format_output helper.

The script checks dependencies and the LLM connection before starting main execution.

ShellCheck on cody reports many warnings about unused variables, quoting, and other style issues

Issues & Improvements
1. Missing /image command implementation
The README and help text mention an /image command, but the script does not define handle_image. This leads to an error if a user tries the command.

Suggested task
Implement handle_image function

Start task
2. Undefined format_output helper
handle_chat calls format_output to display AI responses, but no such function exists in the script.

Suggested task
Provide format_output helper

Start task
3. Hard‑coded configuration values
GEMMA_ENDPOINT and MODEL_NAME are set directly in the script, requiring edits to change them.

Suggested task
Allow configuration via environment variables

Start task
4. Editor selection not configurable
handle_edit only tries nano or vim. Respecting the $EDITOR variable would give users more flexibility.

Suggested task
Use EDITOR environment variable in handle_edit

Start task
5. Lack of HTTP error handling in call_gemma
call_gemma suppresses all curl errors, which can hide connectivity or API issues.

Suggested task
Improve API error handling

Start task
6. README references a feature that doesn’t exist
Since /image isn’t implemented, README instructions are misleading.

Suggested task
Update README for actual functionality

Start task
7. Missing LICENSE file
README states the project is MIT licensed, but no LICENSE file exists.

Suggested task
Add LICENSE file

Start task
8. Numerous ShellCheck warnings
ShellCheck reports many style and quoting issues.

Suggested task
Address ShellCheck warnings

Start task
Testing
✅ bash -n cody – script has no syntax errors

❌ shellcheck cody – produced multiple warnings, indicating style issues
