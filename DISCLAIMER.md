- **No warranty or guarantee** of safety, security, or correctness
- **Always review generated code** before execution in production environments
- **Run in isolated environments** when testing new features
- **Keep backups** of important files (Cody creates its own backups but don't rely solely on them)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features**

- Basic safety checks block dangerous commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, etc.)
- Automatic backup creation before self-modifications
- Confirmation prompts for command execution
- Limited context to prevent token overflow

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal**

- **No liability** for any damage, data loss, or system issues
- **Educational/experimental use only** - not intended for production systems
