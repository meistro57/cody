# ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

## Important Notice

**Cody is an experimental self-modifying AI assistant that executes shell commands and modifies code automatically.**

### 🚨 **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

- **Cody executes commands directly on your system** - it can create, modify, or delete files
- **Cody can modify its own source code** - behaviour may change unexpectedly
- **No warranty or guarantee** of safety, security, or correctness
- **Always review generated code** before execution in production environments
- **Run in isolated environments** when testing new features
- **Keep backups** of important files (Cody creates its own backups but don't rely solely on them)

### 🛡️ **Safety Features**

- Basic safety checks block dangerous commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, etc.)
- Automatic backup creation before self-modifications
- Confirmation prompts for command execution
- Limited context to prevent token overflow

### ⚖️ **Legal**

- **No liability** for any damage, data loss, or system issues
- **Educational/experimental use only** - not intended for production systems
- **You are responsible** for understanding what Cody does before using it
- **Compliance with local laws** regarding AI and automated systems is your responsibility

### 🔧 **Recommendations**

- ✅ Test in virtual machines or containers first
- ✅ Review the system prompt (`cody_system.txt`) before use
- ✅ Monitor Cody's actions closely, especially self-modifications
- ✅ Keep regular backups of your work
- ❌ Don't use on production systems without extensive testing
- ❌ Don't run with elevated privileges unless absolutely necessary

**By using Cody, you acknowledge that you understand these risks and accept full responsibility for any consequences.**
